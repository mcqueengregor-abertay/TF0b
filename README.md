# TF0b
TF0b is a community made, open-source game focusing on fast, parkour-based  infantry movement, paired with large, more tactical, mech based gameplay.  A large focus will be put on player customisation and community involvement.

This repository hosts the TF0b game source. The game is made in the Unity engine, because while powerful, Unity is highly accessible and allows more opportunity for community involvement.

## Installation
